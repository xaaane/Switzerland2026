### **Schedule**

**8:00 AM - 8:30 AM: Breakfast & Preparation**

*   **Action:** Enjoy breakfast at your hotel in Lucerne.
*   **Action:** Prepare a daypack. Sturdy hiking shoes are a must. Also pack water, high-energy snacks, sunscreen, sunglasses, a hat, and a light rain jacket, as mountain weather can be unpredictable.

*   **8:39 AM:** Depart from Lucerne's main train station on a train bound for Schwyz.
*   **9:27 AM:** Arrive at Schwyz station.
*   **Action:** Follow the signs to the bus terminal and board the bus (usually right outside the station) towards "Stoosbahn".
*   **Action:** At the "Stoosbahn" valley station, ride the world's steepest funicular railway up to the car-free village of Stoos.
*   **Travel Time:** Approximately 1 hour 10 minutes.

*   **Action:** Take the chairlift up to the Klingenstock summit. This is where your hike begins.

**10:30 AM - 1:30 PM: The Stoos Ridge Hike (Klingenstock to Fronalpstock)**

*   **The Hike:** This is the highlight of the day. The well-maintained but challenging trail follows the narrow ridge connecting the two peaks. The path offers continuous, stunning 360-degree views over ten lakes, including the entirety of Lake Lucerne, and countless alpine peaks.
*   **Hiking Time:** Approximately 2-3 hours.
*   **Distance:** 4.7 km (2.9 miles).
