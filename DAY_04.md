### **Practical Information & Tips**

*   **Swiss Travel Pass:** Your pass covers the trains between Wengen and Lauterbrunnen, as well as the bus to Trümmelbach Falls. It also provides a discount on the Trümmelbach Falls entrance fee.
*   **Trümmelbach Falls:** It can be cool and misty inside the falls, so a light rain jacket is recommended. The stone paths can also be slippery, so wear shoes with good grip.
*   **Flexibility:** This is a very flexible day. You can choose to spend more time in Wengen in the morning or head down to the valley earlier.
*   **Walking:** The walk from Lauterbrunnen to Trümmelbach is flat, easy, and scenic if you prefer it over the bus.
