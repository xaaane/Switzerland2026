# Directory Overview

This directory contains a detailed, day-by-day travel itinerary for a multi-day trip to Switzerland. The trip covers several major regions, including Lucerne, the Jungfrau Region (Wengen, Grindelwald), and Zermatt.

The project is collaborative, with the itinerary being built and refined through a series of interactions. Each finalized day plan is saved as a separate Markdown file.

# Key Files

The core content is stored in a series of Markdown files, one for each day of the trip:

*   `DAY_01.md`: Arrival in Switzerland (Zurich Airport) and exploration of Lucerne.
*   `DAY_02.md`: Full-day hiking excursion to the Stoos Ridge.
*   `DAY_03.md`: Travel from Lucerne to Wengen, with exploration of the Lauterbrunnen Valley, Mürren, and Gimmelwald.
*   `DAY_04.md`: A packed travel and sightseeing day involving moving from Wengen to Grindelwald, with excursions to the Brienzer Rothorn and Giessbach Falls.
*   `DAY_05.md`: A full day of activities at Grindelwald-First, including the Cliff Walk, Bachalpsee hike, and adventure activities (Flyer, Mountain Cart, Trottibike).
*   `DAY_06.md`: Travel from Grindelwald to Interlaken, followed by a day trip to Oeschinensee for the Panorama Hike.
*   `DAY_07.md`: Morning sightseeing at Harder Kulm in Interlaken, followed by the scenic train journey to Zermatt.
*   `DAY_08.md`: A full day in Zermatt focused on the Gornergrat railway, Riffelsee lake, and the "Meet the Sheep" hiking trail.

Each file follows a consistent structure:
1.  **Trip Overview:** A short summary of the day's main goals.
2.  **Schedule:** A detailed, time-blocked schedule of activities, travel, and meals.
3.  **Practical Information & Tips:** Actionable advice related to the day's plan, such as ticket information, what to wear, and booking recommendations.
