*   **Action:** After yesterday's early start, enjoy a more relaxed breakfast at your hotel in Grindelwald.
*   **Action:** Take a short walk through Grindelwald village to the **Firstbahn Gondola** valley station.

**10:00 AM - 10:30 AM: Ascend to Grindelwald-First**

*   **Gondola Ride:** Enjoy the 25-minute scenic gondola ride up to **First** (2,168m / 7,113 ft). The views of the surrounding peaks and the Eiger's north face become more impressive as you ascend.

**10:30 AM - 1:00 PM: First Cliff Walk & Hike to Bachalpsee**

*   **First Cliff Walk by Tissot:** Upon arrival at the top, start your adventure with the thrilling cliff walk. This is a metal walkway built onto the sheer side of the mountain, culminating in a viewing platform that juts out 45 meters over the valley, offering spectacular and vertigo-inducing views.
*   **Hike to Bachalpsee:** From the First station, embark on the classic alpine hike to **Bachalpsee (Lake Bachalp)**. The wide, well-maintained path is relatively easy and mostly flat, taking approximately 50 minutes each way.
*   **The Reward:** The lake is your destination. On a calm day, the iconic view of the snow-dusted Schreckhorn mountain reflected in the crystal-clear blue water is a picture-postcard moment. Spend some time relaxing here and taking in the serene beauty.

**1:00 PM - 2:00 PM: Lunch with a View**

*   **Option A (Picnic):** The area around Bachalpsee is an idyllic spot for a picnic lunch that you've packed beforehand.
*   **Option B (Restaurant):** Hike back to the First station and have lunch at the **Berggasthaus First** restaurant, which features a large sun terrace with incredible views.

**2:00 PM - 5:00 PM: The Adventure Package Descent**

*   **Action:** The descent is an adventure in itself. You will work your way down the mountain from station to station using a series of three exciting activities.
*   **1. First Flyer or First Glider:** From the **First** station, you'll take an 800-meter-long zipline down to the **Schreckfeld** station. The Flyer is a seated zipline reaching speeds of up to 84 km/h. The Glider is an alternative where four people are harnessed under a large "eagle," flying down the line.
*   **2. First Mountain Cart:** At **Schreckfeld**, switch to a Mountain Cart. This is a stable, three-wheeled cart with a low center of gravity, making it a fun and safe way to ride down the gravel and dirt track to the **Bort** station.
*   **3. First Trottibike Scooter:** At **Bort**, swap your cart for a Trottibike (a standing scooter with hand brakes). Cruise down the final, paved path through alpine meadows and past farmhouses, all the way back to the outskirts of Grindelwald village.

**5:00 PM Onwards: Relaxation & Dinner in Grindelwald**

*   **Action:** After dropping off your Trottibike, you will be back in Grindelwald. Head back to your hotel to relax and refresh after an action-packed day.
*   **Dining:** Enjoy dinner at a restaurant of your choice in Grindelwald.
