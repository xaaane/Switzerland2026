### **Practical Information & Tips**

*   **Tickets:** For this plan, you will need a ticket that covers **two ascents** and **one descent** on the gondola, plus the three activities of the **Adventure Package**. Check with the ticket office for the best combination. A simple return ticket plus the Adventure Package should work, as the package activities replace one descent.
*   **Swiss Travel Pass:** Your Swiss Travel Pass provides a **50% discount** on the gondola rides. The discount does not apply to the adventure activities themselves.
*   **What to Wear:** Wear sturdy, closed-toe shoes (required for the activities). Bring layers (a windbreaker or light jacket is recommended), sunglasses, and sunscreen.
*   **Check Operating Status:** Before you go, check the live status of the gondola and activities on the Jungfrau Region website, as high winds or bad weather can sometimes cause closures.
*   **Pacing:** Be mindful of the time for your second ascent to ensure you have enough time for the Bachalpsee hike before the last gondola down (usually around 5:30 PM - 6:00 PM, but always check).
