### **Schedule**

**9:00 AM - 10:00 AM: Leisurely Breakfast & Walk to Station**

*   **Action:** Enjoy a relaxed breakfast in Zermatt.
*   **Action:** Walk through the village to the **Gornergrat Bahn** station. It is located directly across the street from the main Zermatt train station where you first arrived.

**10:00 AM - 10:40 AM: Cogwheel Train to Gornergrat**

*   **The Journey:** Board the historic, open-air cogwheel train for the 40-minute journey to the summit. This is Europe's highest open-air cogwheel railway, and the ride itself is an incredible experience.
*   **Tip:** Sit on the **right-hand side** of the train as you ascend. This side offers the best and most frequent views of the Matterhorn.

**10:40 AM - 12:00 PM: Exploring the Gornergrat Summit**

*   **Action:** Arrive at the Gornergrat summit (3,089 m / 10,135 ft).
*   **Viewing Platform:** Walk up to the main viewing platform at the 3100 Kulmhotel. From here, you are treated to one of the most famous panoramas in the Alps: the Matterhorn is the star, but you can also see the Dufourspitze (Switzerland's highest peak), the vast Gorner Glacier, and a total of 29 peaks over 4,000 meters.
*   **Zooom the Matterhorn:** Your ticket may include access to this indoor multimedia experience, which provides more context and different perspectives on the Matterhorn.

**12:00 PM - 1:30 PM: Hike to Riffelsee (Meet the Sheep Trail, Part 1)**

*   **Action:** Begin your hike by following the well-marked trail downhill from the Gornergrat summit, heading towards **Rotenboden**.
*   **Riffelsee Lake:** The trail leads you directly to the shores of **Riffelsee**. This small, serene lake is world-famous for the perfect reflection of the Matterhorn on its surface on calm days. Take plenty of time here for photos.
*   **Lunch:** The area around Riffelsee is an idyllic spot for a picnic lunch while enjoying the view. Alternatively, there is a mountain restaurant at the nearby Rotenboden train station.

**1:30 PM - 3:00 PM: "Meet the Sheep" Trail (Part 2) - Rotenboden to Riffelberg**

*   **The Hike:** From Riffelsee, continue following the trail markers for the "Meet the Sheep" themed hike. The path continues its gentle descent towards the **Riffelberg** station area.
*   **Finding the Sheep:** This section of the trail is where Zermatt's famous Valais Blacknose sheep graze freely during the summer and early autumn. Keep your eyes peeled as you walk through the meadows. The sheep are tagged with GPS, and their location can often be tracked online via the Zermatt tourism website. They are very gentle and famously photogenic.

**3:00 PM - 3:30 PM: Relax at Riffelberg**

*   **Action:** Your hike concludes at **Riffelberg**. The hotel and restaurant here have a large sun terrace that makes for a perfect rest stop. Grab a well-deserved drink and enjoy one last, magnificent view of the Matterhorn before you descend.

**3:30 PM Onwards: Train Back to Zermatt**

*   **Action:** From Riffelberg station, hop on the Gornergrat train for the final section of the journey back down to Zermatt village.

**5:00 PM Onwards: Relax & Dinner in Zermatt**

*   **Action:** You'll have time to relax at your hotel after your day of hiking.
*   **Dining:** For dinner, consider trying a classic Swiss meal. A cheese fondue or a hearty portion of Rösti (a Swiss potato dish) is the perfect reward after a day in the mountains.

### **Practical Information & Tips**

*   **Footwear:** Wear good walking shoes or hiking boots. While the trail is mostly downhill, it is rocky and uneven in places.
